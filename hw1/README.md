This folder contains solutions to HW1 from the [mlzoomcamp course](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master) 2024. See [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/blob/master/cohorts/2024/01-intro/homework.md) for the actual questions.


The solutions are in [hw1.ipynb](hw1.ipynb).

A solution in `R` is also provided in [hw1_R.ipynb](hw1_R.ipynb).

To install an environment with all the needed python and R packages, install [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) and run (from top-level):

```
mamba env create -f setup/mlzoomcamp.yaml
```

You can activate the environment with `mamba activate mlzoomcamp`.

To run the `R` version you will need to install the `IRKernel`. Follow the instructions [here](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/#binary-panel)
