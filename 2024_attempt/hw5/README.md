# Homework 5

Before running the `run_homework.sh` script you need to install `pipenv` and some other dependencies as well as pull a Docker image.

## Preparing the environment


```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
```

## Get the docker image
For Questions 5 and 6 we need a pre-built docker image. Fetch it with

```bash
docker pull svizor/zoomcamp-model:3.11.5-slim
```
